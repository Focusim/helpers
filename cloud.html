<h2>Key HIGHLIGHTS GDPR compliance</h2>
<h3>Achieving GDPR Compliance may seem complicated. This basic checklist will help you to see where your company stands and which areas should be further addressed in line with the GDPR.</h3>
<p>If your organisation determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, it is considered acontroller. If your organisationprocesses personal data on behalf of the controller, it is considered aprocessor. It is possible for your organisation to have both roles. This list is far from a legal exhaustive document; it merely tries to help you to pinpoint the key GDPR requirements.</p>

<h2>Summary – key highlights gdpr compliance</h2>
<h3>Each company (controller) who processes personal data can ask the following questions with respect to GDPR compliance (please note: this list is not limited!):</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p>Is the processing of personal data lawful?</p></li>
    <li><p>Can the controller demonstrate consent (if required) for the processing of personal data?</p></li>
    <li><p>Are special categories of personal data processed?</p></li>
    <li><p>Are data subjects aware of their rights?</p></li>
    <li><p>Are appropriate technical and organisational measures implemented to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the GDPR?</p></li>
    <li><p>Does the controller keep a record of all data processing activities?</p></li>
    <li><p>Is a Data Privacy Officer required?</p></li>
    <li><p>Does the controller need to carry out a Data Processing Impact Assessment?</p></li>
    <li><p>Does the controller make use of controllers for the data processing and if so, are data the data processing’s governed by a data processing agreement?</p></li>
    <li><p>Does the controller transfer personal data outside the EU?</p></li>
    <li><p>Do the website of the controller and the applicable documents, such as privacy- and cookie statement and opt-ins (if necessary) for the processing of personal data comply with the GDPR and other local regulations?</p></li>
    <li><p>Are appropriate technical and organisational measures carried out to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of data processing and does the controller have a security policy in case of breaches?</p></li>
</ul>
